# cpdb

Preprocess assignment, use of force, arrest, ticket, and stop and search data from the Chicago Police Department. The preprocessing uses the [`cpdata`](https://github.com/george-wood/cpdata) package and a make-like pipeline using [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets).

## Development

The preprocessing pipeline is currently in development and the raw data is not yet stored in a publicly accessible repository. Once the raw data is hosted, you will be able to download the data and run the pre-processing steps by executing the code in `run.R`.
